## Orientation Assignment (Java-based)

This assignment will serve as an introduction to schoology and github as well as give students the opportunity to set up their development environment for the technology stack we'll be using during the class.

## Instructions

Install the following list of software using the links provided. 

Be mindful of the noted prerequisites for some of the software listed. When you are finished installing, edit this readme to only contain the text **'complete'**. Then, using git, stage your changes, commit, push, and paste the link to your github repository in a submission in schoology for this assignment. This will signify you have completed the assignment and that you are ready to have a member of the instructional staff review your computer to ensure that all of the tools are installed properly.
